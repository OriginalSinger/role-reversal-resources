## What is this?

This is a list of
[*Gender Role Reversal*](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleReversal)-themed media
(be it Manga, Writings, NSFW Manga, NSFW Writings, Audios, etc) and links to
them. So be warned: there are links to NSFW content in `rrr.md`.

## History

The original version of this list was posted in
[/r/RoleReversal](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleReversal/comments/aam8wv) and
[/r/gentlefemdom](https://www.reddit.com/r/gentlefemdom/comments/aam5sy),
then was transferred to
[Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dbpvCStlmk1TWxlOVFXzUaY2xwdlgReaFL9gMxdtf6Y/edit#)
for better formatting. Then it was taken down for violating the Terms of
Service, so it was transferred to [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/E2D6cyLu).
Finally, I transferred it here so additions to the list are easier to see. I'm
not sure though how strictly this website implements its terms of service, so if
this gets removed as well, I'll probably go back to using Pastebin for a while
until I find a better platform.

## How can I suggest something?

- through github, by:
  - adding an issue
  - making a pull request
- contacting me through
  - reddit at /u/OriginalSinger, or
  - email at originalsinger37@gmail.com

## Other platforms?

As an aside, I'm considering using
[etherpad](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/) (suggested to me by
/u/paper\_fckn\_clip from reddit) to emulate the anonymous collaboration that was
previously done on Google Docs. Unfortunately, it doesn't have any "admin"
feature, where the admin can approve/revert the changes. This makes the etherpad
vulnerable to vandalism. If you have any suggestions for how to solve this,
please let me know. I *could* just do it regardless, and just regularly check it
to clean up vandalism. Maybe I will, just because the other ways to suggest
stuff presents too high a barrier to entry (requiring an email, or a reddit
account, or a github account).
